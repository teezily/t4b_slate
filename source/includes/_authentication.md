# Authentication

The API expects for the key to be included in all requests to the server in a header that looks
like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]`

You can find your API key in Settings in your [account](https://plus.teezily.com/account/settings).

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>[API_KEY]</code> with your personal API key.
