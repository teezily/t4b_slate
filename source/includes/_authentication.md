# Authentication

The API expects for the key to be included in all requests to the server in a header that looks
like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]`

If you already have a Shop API you can find its key in its [settings](/account/shops) otherwise create a new Shop API [here](/account/shop_api/new).

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>[API_KEY]</code> with the key of your Shop API.
